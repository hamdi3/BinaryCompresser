## Overview

BinaryCompresser is a C++ project that provides file compression and decompression functionality. It uses the zlib library for compression and decompression, and offers optional encryption based on the Vernam cipher.

## Features

- **File Compression**: The `file_to_binary_string` function compresses files into a binary format using zlib. It takes a path to the input file and a path to the output compressed binary file as input. It also takes an optional encryption key.

- **File Decompression**: The `binary_string_to_file` function decompresses files from a binary format using zlib. It takes the binary path and the output path as input, as well as an optional decryption key.

- **Optional Encryption**: The optional encryption is based on the Vernam cipher. If a key is provided, the `file_to_binary_string` function will encrypt the file before compression, and the `binary_string_to_file` function will decrypt the file after decompression.

## Usage

You can use BinaryCompresser from the terminal as follows:

To compress a file into a binary:
```bash
./BinaryCompresser --file-to-binary <input_file_path> <output_binary_path> [key]
```

To retrive a file from a binary:
```bash
./BinaryCompresser --binary-to-file <input_binary_path> <output_file_path> [key]
```

## Performance
Iâ€™ve done some performance testing on files up to 200 MBs. Here are the results:

These plots show the time taken to compress files and the size of the compressed files. As you can see, BinaryCompresser is capable of efficiently compressing large files.

## Building
This project uses CMake for building. You can build the project as follows:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will create a `build` directory, change into that directory, generate the Makefile with CMake, and then build the project with Make.
